# Panama and Central America CO2 data visualization
This is a personal project (and thus rarely maintained) involving visualization of CO2 emissions in Panama and Central America, built with the Python framework Dash and deployed to Heroku.

Check it out at https://dash-co2-project.herokuapp.com/

## Running the app locally
First, clone this repository:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Leonardo-M12/dash-co2-project/

$ python3 -m venv myvenv
$ source myvenv/bin/activate
```

Install the requirements:
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the app:
```
$ python app.py
```
